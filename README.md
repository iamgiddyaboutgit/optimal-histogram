# optimal-histogram
This script creates a function that allows R users to make better histograms.  
This new histogram function is meant as an improvement over the base R function *hist*.
We use the Unbiased Cross Validation Criterion to choose good bin widths and origin.

Idea for this function came from the text:

Regression, Classification, and Manifolding Learning
